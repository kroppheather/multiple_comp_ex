#### mult_comp_example_code_appendix.r
Model code for running implementing the three different Bayesian model variant (hierarchical, non-hierarchical, and complete pooling), which also computes the log-likelihood (for the partial pooling index, PPI) and all pairwise differences among group-level means. Models are run or called by the above script.
