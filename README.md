# Bayesian Hierarchical Model Multiple Comparisions Project
A project aimed at identifying the need to account for multiple comparisions in hierarchical Bayesian models. The files contain model code and calculations for examining the degree of the "borrowing of strength" in heirarchical models for multiple comparisions.
